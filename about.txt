History:
======
I love playing sim games or management games. Example: ICC Cricket Captain (cricket management sim), Extreme Warfare Revenge (wrestling manager sim), etc, and then one day I got urged to play a Quidditch management sim, in which you take a role of a manager and control your team. I love Harry Potter book series, and Quidditch, which is an interesting and exciting sport, and I've been playing Virtual Quidditch on a Harry Potter role-playing board (http://www.virtual-hogwarts.org), which has made fantastic rules for playing the game on the board, and everyone there has become addictive to it, but I wanted to play a real sim game on the PC. EA Sports did make a Quidditch Game, but you control the team, which I wasn’t looking for. I wanted a game in which you pick a team, hire players, fire players, train players, etc, and the game will simulate the match using players’ stats as realistically as possible (Yeah, Quidditch isn’t real, but still, lol). I searched Google, but didn't come along with such a game. Tell me if I am wrong, and such a game exists. Anyway, I was very surprised to see that, and since I love programming, Harry Potter, and Quidditch, I decided to make one. It did seem very challenging to simulate Quidditch at first, and it took me about an year to think of algorithms and basic engine, and finally on June 10th, 2007, I sat down and started writing the engine, and on June 12th, 2007, I completed it.

Quidditch Simulator simply takes two teams, their players’ stats, and simulates a Quidditch match. You will get the play-by-play commentary of the match by Lee Jordan. It’s not like a management sim that I mentioned above, because first I wanted to test the engine and make it as perfect as possible.

Simulation:
========
When you first run the application, you will see three buttons. ‘Run’, ’About’, and ‘Exit’. Click on ‘Run’, and you will get another form with two dropdown menus to select two teams to put in a match. You can click on ‘View Lineup’ button to see that team’s lineup. After you have made your selections, click on ‘Simulate’ button, and you will come along with another form with a text area, which will contain the play-by-play commentary by Lee Jordan. Click on ‘Start’ button to simulate the match.

Skills:
==========
There are 8 skills in the sim:
Passing
Shooting
Intercepting
Dodging
Beating/Bludgering/Aiming
Saving
Keeping/Blocking
Seeking

Each skill contains a number from 0 to 100. Higher the number, higher the skill.
==========

Players:
======
Chasers: Chasers are assigned Passing, Shooting, Intercepting, and Dodging skills.  Chasers can pass, shoot, intercept, and dodge.
Beaters: Beaters are assigned Beating/Bludgering/Aiming and Saving skills. Beaters can whack the bludgers at the opposing team’s chasers, or save their own chasers from the bludgers sent by the opposing team’s beaters.
Keepers: Keepers are assigned Keeping/Blocking skill. Keeper’s job is to protect the hoops.
Seekers: Seekers are assigned Seeking skill. Seeker’s job is to catch the snitch before the opposing team’s seeker does.

Adding Teams, Players, Skills:
======================
There would be one file ‘teams.txt’ with the simulator, where you can add teams, players, and their skills. You should enter the data in the following format to make it appear in the simulator. Don’t put any spaces between the lines.

Format:
Team Name
Chaser1 Name, Passing Skill,Shooting Skill,Intercepting Skill,Dodging Skill
Chaser2 Name, Passing Skill,Shooting Skill,Intercepting Skill,Dodging Skill
Chaser3 Name, Passing Skill,Shooting Skill,Intercepting Skill,Dodging Skill
Keeper Name, Keeping Skill
Seeker Name, Seeking Skill
Beater1 Name, Beating Skill,Saving Skill
Beater2 Name, Beating Skill,Saving Skill

Example:
Gryffindor
"Katie Bell",65,81,64,63
"Alicia Spinnet",72,75,64,59
"Angelina Johnson",93,95,73,77
"Oliver Wood",90
"Harry Potter",95
"Fred Weasley",85,90
"George Weasley",85,90
======================

Final Note:
========
Expect different results each time. Every match will be different from the last one. If one team's seeker is stronger, then it doesn’t mean that he will always, always catch the snitch. Upsets can happen, though they would be rare.
